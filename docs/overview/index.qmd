`StructuralVibration.jl` is a Julia package designed to generate vibration data for mechanical systems. This package can be used for educational and research purposes. As a teacher, you can use it to illustrate vibration theory and its practical implementation. As a researcher, you can use it to test new methods on synthetic data.

::: {.callout-warning}
The package is under active development and is not yet registered in the Julia General Registry. The package is developed as part of my research activities on source identification in structural dynamics and acoustics.
